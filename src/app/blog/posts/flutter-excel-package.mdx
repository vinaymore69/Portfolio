## About

SheetUI Excel View is a powerful Excel-like table engine for Flutter that enables you to build advanced data grids, editable forms, dashboards, and spreadsheet-style interfaces directly inside your apps.

It supports cell editing, dropdowns, checkboxes, buttons, merged cells, virtualization for large datasets, keyboard navigation, and CSV export — all with a clean architecture designed for performance and scalability.

Unlike traditional table widgets, SheetUI is built as a rendering engine rather than a simple UI component, making it suitable for enterprise-grade applications.
